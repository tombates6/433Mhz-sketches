## Making the modules work for me
	I found that these were really temperamental when it came to actually having an antenna. After about an hour of tinkering with the code and writing it down verbatim from tons of examples, I finally tried adding antennas to the things, and they worked like a charm. **If you don't have antennas on either of the modules, they will not communicate no matter how close you bring them!** There is a lot to be said for the importance of taking physics into account with your projects.
